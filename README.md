Playlist shuffler for my waterproof swimming headphones

My waterproof swimming headphones (and maybe yours too) have two modes: a Bluetooth mode for connecting to a device with Spotify on it, and an MP3 mode for playing songs stored on the headphones themselves.

The problem is twofold: submerging the headphones in water interferes with the Bluetooth signal, so I can't play my workout playlist from Spotify, and there's no shuffle functionality for the headphones' MP3 mode, so my workout playlist would have to be in the same order every time, which I'd rather avoid.

Enter shuffle.py. Load the MP3 files onto the headphones, run the script, and take your shuffled playlist right on down to the pool.
